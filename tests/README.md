# To run all tests:
#   pytest tests/
#
# This project uses pytest for all test discovery and reporting.
#
# Test coverage includes:
# - Core logic (file creation, album list, image generation)
# - CLI help/usage output
# - User experience improvements (album count, output messages)
#
# Add more tests for CLI flows, error handling, and edge cases as needed.
